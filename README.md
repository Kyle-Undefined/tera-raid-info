## Features

<details open>
<summary>5 & 6 Star Raids</summary>
<br>
Compiled the data for the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/scarletviolet/teraraidbattles/5star.shtml" target="_blank">5 Star</a> and <a href="https://www.serebii.net/scarletviolet/teraraidbattles/6star.shtml" target="_blank">6 Star</a> raids from Serebii. Shows only the raids for the selected tier.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pok√©mon Type(s)</summary>
<br>
Shows the Type(s) of the selected Pok√©mon. Useful for knowing which moves are STAB since Tera Type doesn't remove it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pok√©mon Image</summary>
<br>
Shows the normal and shiny images for the selected Pok√©mon side by side. Just incase you get lucky with a ‚≠êÔ∏èshiny‚≠êÔ∏è raid.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Base Stats</summary>
<br>
Helpful to know if the Pok√©mon is a Physical or Special attacker, or how tanky it is. Great for knowing what protecting move your support Pok√©mon should have. For example, Reflect for Physical attackers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Abilities</summary>
<br>
Shows each ability the Pok√©mon can have for the raid, and if it's their Hidden Ability* it will be marked with (H). Hovering over the Ability will display the information about it, and if you're on mobile clicking it will work.
<br><br>

> *Note: For 5 Star raids, Pok√©mon appear to not have their Hidden Ability, with some exceptions (Ditto). For 6 Star raids, Pok√©mon can have their Hidden Ability. This is based on the data from Serebii. If it's wrong, let me know.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Moves</summary>
<br>

Shows the move set of the raid Pok√©mon. Each move is color coded to the Type it is, with Status moves always showing last in the list. Hovering over (or clicking) the move will display the information for it, like the Base Power, if it's a Physical/Special/Status, Description and more. If the move is a Physical or Special attack, then it will display the Type advantages of the move Type.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Herba Mystica Drops</summary>
<br>

Shows all the Herba Mystica the raid Pok√©mon can drop, along with the chance of getting it. Useful for hunting certain Herba Mystica for sandwiches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Type Advantages / Weaknesses</summary>
<br>

<b>Advantages:</b>
Shows all of the Type advantages from the move set the raid Pok√©mon has that are non Status moves. Only shows Super Effective advantages.
<br><br>
<b>Weaknesses:</b>
When a Tera Type is selected, shows all of the Type matchups for the selected Type, including its resistances and immunities.
<br><br>
If the raid Pok√©mon move set includes the Tera Blast move, then the Super Effective advantages of that Tera Type are shown. Useful for going up against the Eevee-lutions and other Pok√©mon with the move.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Raid Sharing</summary>
<br>

You can share the raid choices with others, by simply clicking the Share icon in the header and it will automatically copy to your clipboard. This will set the Raid Tier, Pok√©mon and Tera Type to auto load for others who click the link. For example, <a href="https://kyle-undefined.github.io/tera-raid-info/6/Garchomp/Fairy" target="_blank">6 Star Fairy Garchomp</a>.
